Tap2unlock
==========


Application control for the tap2unlock kernel feature.This obviously supports only android and is useful only to 
the phones installed with custom kernel suporting the t2u feature . 

Warning : Dont make an app for t2u urself 

The reason why this is open is for improvement , want something , u can ofcourse commit it.
The aim is to keep one and only one t2u control app , that will serve everyones needs .

Disclaimer :

-I know this code is stupid , unaligned and sometimes unreasonable coding style,conditional blocks or naming style.
-Its also made open to make it clean and efficient coz i dont feel like making it clean if its closed.
-If u find a security vulnerability , rather pointing it out come up with a solution.


Respect developers and open source .
open source doesnt mean no respect , no credit or available to steal and claim it your's
